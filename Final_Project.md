# Final Project: Building an AI Agent Application

## Project Overview
In this final project, students will leverage the knowledge acquired throughout the course on Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems to develop an AI agent application that addresses a real-world problem. The project encourages creativity and the application of theoretical and practical skills learned.

## Project Objectives
1. **Design an AI Agent**: Conceptualize and implement an intelligent agent that can perform a specific task.
2. **Utilize Multi-Agent Systems**: Collaborate multiple agents to work collectively on complex tasks.
3. **Create a User Interface**: Develop a simple GUI using frameworks like Streamlit to enhance user interaction with the AI agents.
4. **Demonstrate Learning Outcomes**: Showcase understanding of LLMs, asynchronous programming, and machine learning operations in a practical application.

## Project Requirements
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: 
  - Streamlit for UI
  - PyTorch and Transformers for building LLM applications
  - Other libraries as needed (e.g., Pandas, NumPy)
- **Functionality**: The AI agent should be able to:
  - Receive user inputs
  - Process the inputs using multi-agent collaboration
  - Provide informative outputs or perform tasks based on the inputs
  - Ensure a user-friendly interface

## Task Breakdown
### 1. Conceptualization (Week 1-2)
- Identify a problem that can be addressed with AI agents (e.g., a travel planner, grocery assistant, etc.).
- Define the roles of each agent in your system (e.g., weather agent, hotel booking agent for a travel planner).

### 2. Development (Week 3-5)
- **Design the Agents**:
  - Implement each agent with specific functionalities.
  - Use an LLM to enhance agent capabilities (task processing, decision making).

- **Integration**:
  - Enable communication between agents for collaborative tasks.
  - Use prompting techniques to elicit effective responses from the LLMs.

### 3. User Interface Creation (Week 6)
- Develop a front end using Streamlit.
- Incorporate interactive elements such as forms and buttons to collect user inputs and display outputs.

### 4. Testing and Evaluation (Week 7)
- Test the application for functionality and user experience.
- Gather feedback and refine the application based on user interactions.

### 5. Documentation and Presentation (Week 8)
- Prepare documentation detailing the project architecture, design choices, and how to run the application.
- Create a presentation to showcase the project, explaining the problem addressed, the solution implemented, and the learning outcomes.

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit the project as a GitHub repository containing:
  - Source code
  - Documentation in Markdown format
  - A demonstration video or live demo link (if possible)
- Final presentations will be conducted in class during the last week.

## Assessment Criteria
- **Functionality**: Does the application work as intended?
- **Creativity**: Is there an innovative approach to problem-solving?
- **Usability**: How user-friendly is the interface?
- **Technical Implementation**: Quality of code and application structure.
- **Documentation**: Clarity and detail in documentation provided.

Students are encouraged to collaborate, share resources, and seek help when necessary. This project is an opportunity to apply what you have learned in a practical context, showcasing your skills in AI and LLMs.
